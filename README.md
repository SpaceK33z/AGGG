# A(( Website

Currently deployed **https://aggg.space/**.

## Development

To develop on this you'll need Node v12 and Yarn.

To get a local version running, run `yarn && yarn start` in the terminal.

On each push to the repository the site gets built by Netlify. If the commit is in `master`, it will be deployed to production. Pushing to `develop` or another branch will not result in production builds but other URL's (TODO).
